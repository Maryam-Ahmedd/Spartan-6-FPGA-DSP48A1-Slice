# Spartan-6-FPGA-DSP48A1-Slice
This project Implements and tests the DSP48A1 slice in Spartan-3A FPGAs. Features include an 18-bit pre-adder, 18x18 multiplier, 48-bit adder/accumulator, and configurable pipelining. Verilog code supports arithmetic operations and cascading, with a testbench validating functionality.
